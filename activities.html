                    <p class="text-light">Fishing has always been something I enjoy ever since I was a kid.
                        Where I live there aren't any really exciting places to fish but as long as can see some fish
                        I'm having fun, I don't even need to catch them to enjoy it. I've been to a few spots fishing that
                        are really beautiful and it just adds more excitement to fishing.

                    <h2 class="text-light">Paintball</h2>
                    <p class="text-light">I've gone paintballing quite a bit with my family, sometimes for birthdays
                        or just when I really want to. You can click the photo to look at my favorite field to go to,
                        they have some really nice refs there and they don't tolerate any fights which happen quite a bit
                        in paintball.<br><br>
                        If you can tolerate a little bit of pain I recommend you try out paintballing
                        it can be a lot of fun!

                    <h2 class="text-light">Puzzle</h2>
                    <p class="text-light">Puzzles are fun, relaxing, and give you a challenge without being 
                        super intesive or aggrivating. Whenever I'm bored on my PC or just don't want to play 
                        video games I visit a website that lets you choose any picture you want for a puzzle and 
                        set the difficulty. I've completed maybe 20 or more puzzles on it already! You can also share the link to your puzzle and solve it together with your friends.
                        <br><br>
                        You can check it out by clicker the puzzle photo to the right, I highly advise you do!
