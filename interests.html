                    <p class="text-light">Games are an easy way to zone out and have fun. There is so many options
                        out there but my favorite types of games are hardcore survival FPS games like Rust. Video
                        games are much more enjoyable for me when playing with other friends, it's a fun way to hangout
                        online and work together. <br><br>Single player games can also be very enjoyable, especially if they have
                        a good and exciting story like God of War.

                    <h2 class="text-light">Fish / Aquatic Animals</h2>
                    <p class="text-light">I have a deep interest in anything that lives in water, I find
                        watching fish swimming peacefully is very relaxing. I dug my own pond by hand
                        in my back yard and stocked it with koi fish, the same ones in the picture on the right.
                        They have grown to be twice the size they were in that photo and will most likely continue
                        to grow even bigger.
                        <br><br>
                        I think anyone who likes fish would enjoy having a koi fish whether it be in a pond or a tank.
                        They are quite resilient and smart, its not to hard to teach them tricks either.
                        Koi only grow as big as their envirement will let them, but that also means if you put them 
                        in a big space they will grow very big.

                    <h2 class="text-light">Computers</h2>
                    <p class="text-light">I got my first computer when I was 14, it was a slow Toshiba
                        laptop but it felt like I had a whole new world of freedom with it as there 
                        was an insane amount of PC games compared to console. After getting into
                        video games I wanted a faster computer and saved up for a desktop PC and 
                        learned how to take it apart and upgrade it with better parts over time.
                        <br><br>I wanted something even faster so I saved up for some years
                        so I could build my own pc with the best parts I could find. The computer in the
                        photo on the right is my custom built PC. You can click it to visit Newegg which is the
                        website I bought all my parts from. <br>(excluding the 3080 FE)
